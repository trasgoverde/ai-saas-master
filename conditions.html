    <p>Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) and our <a href="#">Privacy Notice</a>
      (“<strong>Privacy Notice</strong>”) carefully because they govern your use of the CopyAI, Inc.
      (“<strong>DIPASS.IO</strong>”) website located at www.DIPASS.IO (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), Dipassio AI´s copy content
      generation services, and any copy content generated by Dipassio AI´s services for you based on your User Content
      (defined below) (“<strong>Generated Content</strong>”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our
      services, and the Generated Content are collectively called the “<strong>Services</strong>.”</p>
   
    <p><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agreement to Terms.</strong> By using our Services,
      you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If
      you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you
      represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and
      “your” will refer to that entity.</p>
    <p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Privacy Notice.</strong> Please review our Privacy
      Notice, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your
      information.</p>
    <p><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Changes to these Terms or the Services.</strong> We
      may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated
      Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
      update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it
      means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the
      Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the
      Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who May Use the Services?</strong></p>
    <p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with
      DIPASS.IO, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law.</p>
    <p>For certain features of the Services you will need an account. It is important that you provide us with accurate,
      complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to
      suspend or terminate your account. To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential,
      and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your
      account.</p>
    <p><strong>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Feedback.</strong> We appreciate feedback, comments,
      ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”). If you choose to
      submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.</p>
    <p><strong>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subscriptions.</strong> DIPASS.IO requires payment of a
      fee for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof) and you agree to pay such fees.</p>
    <p><strong>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>General. When you purchase a subscription for the
      Services (“<strong>Subscription</strong>”), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to
      charge you for such Subscription. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Subscription,
      including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for
      billing and notification (such information, “<strong>Payment Information</strong>”). You represent and warrant
      that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you
      initiate a Subscription, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete
      the transaction related to your Subscription and to charge your payment method for the type of Subscription you
      have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to
      verify your identity before completing your Subscription (such information is included within the definition of
      Payment Information). By initiating a Subscription, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies
      applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All payments for Subscriptions
      are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable
      taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars.</p>
    <p><strong>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Subscriptions. If you purchase a Subscription, you
      will be charged the annual Subscription fee, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (“<strong>Subscription
        Fee</strong>”), at the beginning of your Subscription and each year thereafter, at the then-current Subscription
      Fee. BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AUTHORIZE DIPASS.IO TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET
      FORTH BELOW. If you purchase a Subscription, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge
      you each year on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have
      provided until you cancel your Subscription. No less than thirty (30) days and no more than sixty (60) days before
      your Subscription term ends, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, DIPASS.IO will send you a reminder with
      the then-current Subscription Fee. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you
      acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring
      payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or DIPASS.IO. Your Subscription continues
      until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Subscription in accordance with
      these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Cancelling Your Subscription. You may cancel your
      Subscription for a full refund within ten (10) calendar days of your initial purchase. AFTER THAT, YOUR PURCHASE
      IS FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT ANY
      TIME. But if something unexpected happens in the course of completing a transaction, we reserve the right to
      cancel your transaction for any reason; if we cancel your transaction we will refund any payment you have already
      remitted to us for such transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time,
      but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
      EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PURCHASE, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY
      PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To
      cancel, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:cancel@DIPASS.IO">cancel@DIPASS.IO</a>. You will be responsible for
      all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription
      period. If you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current
      Subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.</p>
    <p><strong>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Free Trials. We may offer to certain qualifying
      users paid Subscriptions on a free trial basis (“<strong>Free Trial</strong>”) for a specified period of time. If
      we offer you a Free Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial will be provided at signup. Your use of the Free
      Trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms. Certain limitations may exist with respect to
      combining Free Trials with any other offers. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the
      Free Trial offer, Free Trials are only available to users who have not previously held a paid Subscription. When
      you agree to a Free Trial, you are also agreeing to sign up for a paid Subscription as described above and,
      consequently, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your Free Trial, we (or our third party
      payment processor) will begin charging your payment method on a recurring annual basis for the applicable annual
      fee (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) at the end of the Free Trial until you cancel your Subscription.
      If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Information, you must cancel your Subscription prior to midnight
      Eastern Time on the last day of your Free Trial period. Instructions for cancelling your subscription are stated
      in the section above titled “Canceling Your Subscription.”</p>

      that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You represent and
      warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available
      through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by DIPASS.IO on or through the Services will infringe,
      misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or
      result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
    <p><strong>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Removal of User Content. You can remove your User
      Content by specifically deleting it. You should know that in certain instances, some of your User Content, (such
      as posts or comments you make), may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to
      exist on the Services. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or
      deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.</p>

    <p><strong>16. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dispute Resolution.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree
      that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
      enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively,
      “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved <strong>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a
        class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>. You and DIPASS.IO agree that the U.S. Federal
      Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and DIPASS.IO are each
      waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive
      termination of these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 16(a)
      above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain
      the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
      misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p><strong>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The
      arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer
      Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA
      Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who
      wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party
      as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a
        href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">www.adr.org</a>.</p>
    <p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a
      different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues
      relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing,
      administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the
      administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute
      frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover
      them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to
      the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>(e) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as
      provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
      asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
      seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To
      the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that
      has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the
      entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
      arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending
      the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
    <p><strong>(f) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Class Action Waiver. <strong>YOU AND DIPASS.IO
        AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
        PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, if the parties’
      Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your
      claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
      provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and
      void.</p>
    <p><strong>(g) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Severability. With the exception of any of the
      provisions in Section 16(f) of these Terms (“<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>”), if an arbitrator or court of
      competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these
      Terms will still apply.</p>
    <p><strong>17. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;General Terms.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Reservation of Rights. DIPASS.IO and its licensors

      entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between DIPASS.IO and you regarding the Services, and these Terms
      supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between DIPASS.IO and you regarding the

      of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of
      law or otherwise, without Dipassio AI´s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms,
      without such consent, will be null. DIPASS.IO may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject
      to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted
      assigns.</p>

      notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
    <p><strong>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Waiver of Rights. Dipassio AI´s failure to enforce any
      right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any
      such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
      DIPASS.IO. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
      these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
